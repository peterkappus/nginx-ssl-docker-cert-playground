# ngnx Self-Signed Cert Playground

A place to learn about certs & stuff...

Use Centos cuz that's what we have at work.

Try [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-on-centos-7)

## Idea:

Two docker containers:
1. The server, create a Dockerfile to set up nginx, and add a certificate.
2. The client. create a dockerfile to setup wget and a client certifiate created via the server or something.


## What about CAs?
yes, what about them...?
